# CompressedSinglefileData

* In development! *

Somehow not really worth a plugin but can be useful in some cases.
Provides `CompressedSinglefileData` nodes which work like `SingleFileData`
except that they only take files (and not filelikes) and save the files
`zip` compressed.

This can be useful for larger simulation output files (like MD trajectories).
